# Database Schema (Initial Inventory)

ConnectionStrings all target SQL Server `173.214.167.37` (ALSADEQezeekw) with multiple names.

This repo does not include .sql schema files. Schema is inferred at runtime by Code On Time controllers and custom pages.

Tables referenced implicitly by roles/pages (from web.config <location>):
- Financial: GL*, BankandCash*, GLTransaction, GLjrnvchhdr*, glstatment*
- Sales/AR: STsalhdr*, Stcustmr, InvoicesDetailsReports
- Purchase/AP: Stpurhdr*, Suppliers, PurchaseDetailsReports
- HR: HR*, TimeAttendance*, Employees
- School domain: sch*, School*, Student*, ResultStudent, Transportation

Next steps:
- Use SQL Server to script schema and ERD
- Inventory Code On Time data controllers under App_Data/Controllers (if present) or App_Code/eZee.Data
